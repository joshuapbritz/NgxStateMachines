# Ngx State Machines

This is an attempt to use state machines as an extension of the Angular platform. The most important thing about this experiment for me, was to make sure that the actions for each state were part of the Angular component itself, and won't have to be called via a key lookup layer.

### To-Do
- Add decorator for state specific properties
- Generate a state machine schema based on the machine's given states
- Detailed error handling
